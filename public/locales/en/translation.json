        "question": "What does <i>Barrierelos</i> mean?",

      },
      "website-vs-webpage": {
        "question": "What is difference between a website and a webpage?",
        "answer": "A website is a collection of webpages. For example, the website <i>barrierelos.ch</i> consists of multiple webpages like <i>barrierelos.ch/faq</i>, <i>barrierelos.ch/login</i> and <i>barrierelos.ch/profile</i>."
      },
      "wcag-explanation": {
        "question": "What is <i>WCAG</i>?",
        "answer": "<i>WCAG</i> is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that has the goal to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. It defines many criteria a website should fulfill to be accessible. The criteria are grouped into four categories called principles: <i>Perceivable</i>, <i>Operable</i>, <i>Understandable</i> and <i>Robust</i>. Each principle is further divided into guidelines and each guideline is divided into success criteria. The WCAG standard is widely used in the field of web accessibility and is also the basis of many national laws and regulations."
      },
      "barrierelos-score-explanation": {
        "question": "What is the <i>Barrierelos-Score</i>?",
        "answer": "The <i>Barrierelos-Score</i> is a rating between 0 and 100. It is derived from an automated scan of the website using the Axe-core accessibility engine. The score is based on the number of accessibility issues found on the website and the severity of these issues. The higher the score, the better the accessibility of the website. Please note that an automated scan can only find a subset of all accessibility issues. Therefore the Barrierelos-Score should only be considered a <strong>limited approximation</strong> of the actual accessibility of the website."
      },
      "barrierelos-score-calculation": {
        "question": "How is the Barrierelos-Score calculated?",
        "answer": "The Axe-core accessibility engine runs a number of tests on each relevant HTML element for a specific test. This results in a large list of tests performed, from which we can derive the total number of elements that passed or failed a specific test. Each test also has an associated issue severity: minor, moderate, serious or critical, which determines the impact on the accessibility if an element fails this test. We assign a <i>severity value</i> to each issue severity respectively: 2, 4, 8, 16. We then calculated the <i>violation value</i> by multiplying the number of elements that failed the test by the issue severity. We define the <i>weight</i> of a rule to be the violation value plus the number of elements that passed the test. So now we have a violation value and a weight for each test. To calculate the score of a webpage, we divide the sum of the violation values of all tests by the sum of the weights of all tests. This results in a number between 0 and 1, which we multiply by 100 to get the Barrierelos-Score. To calculate the score of a whole website, we simply calculate the weighted arithmetic mean of all webpages of the website."
